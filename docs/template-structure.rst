Template structure
==================

The DRT uses `Django templating <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/templates/>`_. Generic templates are defined in `lib-cove-web <https://github.com/opendataservices/lib-cove-web>`_ and include various blocks which can be overridden here if necessary.

In lib-cove-web you will find:

* The base template for the landing page.
* Include templates for data input and tables for the results.
* Various error pages.
* Terms and conditions, usage statistics, analytics.

In cove-ocds (this repo) you will find specialisations of these, either some blocks or entire templates.

* The base, input, and some of the result table templates customise text and appearance for the OCDS DRT.
* ``explore_base``, ``explore_record`` and ``explore_release`` modify the base ``explore`` template depending on the data input.
* Additional template partials which are included in other templates.

Translating template strings
----------------------------

For more about translation in general, see :doc:`translations`.

Some of the templates include variables for the translation of generic terms so that they can easily be reused. For example, in ``explore.html`` (lib-cove-web) you will find:

.. code:: html

  {% trans 'Converted from Original' as converted %}
  {% trans 'Original' as original %}
  {% trans 'Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx)' as xlsx %} 
  {% trans 'CSV Spreadsheet (.csv)' as csv %} 
  {% trans 'Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx) with titles' as xlsx_titles %} 
  {# Translators: JSON probably does not need a transalation: http://www.json.org/ #}
  {% trans 'JSON' as JSON %}
  {% trans 'XML' as XML %}

Which means that in templates that override or are included in ``explore.html`` you can simply use, for example:

.. code:: html

    <p>{{ xlsx_titles }}</p>
